    "## Part 1 - Design (weighted factor for grades = 2)\n",
    "### 1. Design and explain interactions between main components in your architecture of mysimbdp. (1 point)\n",
    "\n",
    "According to the assignment, there are 3 main components in mysimbdp.\n",
    "\n",
    "1) **mysimbdp-coredms** - here we store and manage our data. For this task I chosed MongoDB as a platform where my database will be located.\n",
    "\n",
    "2) **mysimbdp-daas** - here we should set up APIs, which later on might be usaed by users to get access to stored data and also be able to both write and read data\n",
    "\n",
    "3) **mysimbdp-dataingest** - this component is used to read data from the external files or databases. Also we should be able to download data to  mysimbdp-coredms by calling its' APIs\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Explain how many nodes are needed in the deployment of mysimbdp-coredms so that this component can work property (theoretically based on the selected technology ) (1 point)\n",
    "\n",
    "The amount of nodes depends mostly  on the **replication factor**. In our case on a free server (M0 Free Tier), replication Factor is set to 3 Nodes by default and cannot be changed. Replication factor shows how many replicas of our original database we created.\n",
    "\n",
    "The more replicas of your database you have the more secure your data is stored. Since nodes are independent of each other, if one node breaks your database still might be supported by other nodes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another important factor is **sharding**. If you desided to split your data and to store it on several nodes, the amound of nodes depends on your node capasity. \n",
    "\n",
    "To sum up, when one chooses amount of nodes, they should think about how save they want to store their data and also they should keep in mind the capasity of nodes they use.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Will you use VMs or containers for mysimbdp and explain the reasons for each component (1 point)\n",
    "\n",
    "Firstly lets list some features of VMs and containers.\n",
    "\n",
    "**VMs**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Heavyweight\n",
    "- Limited performance\n",
    "- Each VM runs in its own OS\n",
    "- Hardware-level virtualization\n",
    "- Startup time in minutes\n",
    "- Allocates required memory\n",
    "- Fully isolated and hence more secure\n",
    "\n",
    "**Containers**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Lightweight\n",
    "- Native performance\n",
    "- All containers share the host OS\n",
    "- OS virtualization\n",
    "- Startup time in milliseconds\n",
    "- Requires less memory space\n",
    "- Process-level isolation, possibly less secure\n",
    "\n",
    "For current study purposes, I will go with containers for all components, since it's easy and faster to implement, plus MongoDB perfectly works with Docker.\n",
    "\n",
    "For **mysimbdp-daas** and **mysimbdp-dataingest**, I will use Dockerized API. Since it solve most of the problems, which might arise with VMs, for instance, lack of memory (since we need to allocate memmory to run VM).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. Explain how would you scale mysimbdp to allow a lot of users using mysimbdp-dataingestto push data into mysimbdp (1 point)\n",
    "\n",
    "Curently, I'm using M0 Free Tier, which put some limitations:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Maximum of 100 operations per second\n",
    "- Clusters limit the total data transferred into or out of the cluster as 10 GB per week\n",
    "\n",
    "The way, how I will scale my database, depends on data. If I have to create database for small start-up in short period of time, I guess it will be easy both for deployment and supporting to go with **vertical scaling**. It involves increasing the capacity of a single server, such as using a more powerful CPU, adding more RAM, or increasing the amount of storage space. \n",
    "\n",
    "But if we are speaking about Big Data, I will choose horizontal scaling. So to allow more users, to push data into **mysimbdp**, I will be using **sharding**. It is a method for distributing data across multiple machines.  MongoDB uses sharding to support deployments with very large data sets and high throughput operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "MongoDB uses **horizontal scaling**, which involves dividing the system dataset and load over multiple servers, adding additional servers to increase capacity as required. While the overall speed or capacity of a single machine may not be high, each machine handles a subset of the overall workload, potentially providing better efficiency than a single high-speed high-capacity server. \n",
    "\n",
    "### 5. Explain your choice of industrial cloud infrastructure and/or mysimbdp-coredms provider, when you do not have enough infrastructural resources for provisioning mysimbdp (1 point)\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are pros of using MongoDB:\n",
    "\n",
    "- It is Document oriented. It based on collecrtion of documents, which might have different size. That is rather logical, that different entities have differnt structure\n",
    "\n",
    "- It has high performance\n",
    "\n",
    "- It has high availability - it supports replication, which garantee more relible data storage\n",
    "\n",
    "- It has high scalability. It supports sharding and good documentation to implement it. SInce we work with Big Data, it might be inavitabe to use horizontal scaling\n",
    "\n",
    "- It support cloud distributions such as AWS\n",
    "\n",
    "- It is good for Real-time analytics,high-speed logging and caching\n",
    "\n",
    "- Data Representation in JSON or BSON. So it is easy to both push and download data from database"

    "### 2. Explain how would you partition the data in mysimbdp-coredms into different shards/partitions (1 point)\n",
    "\n",
    "In my case I won't do this, because I am on a free account. But in theory, to shard data in MongoDB, firstly, we need to set up *sharding cluster*, which has the following structure:\n",
    "\n",
    "- *shard*: Each shard contains a subset of the sharded data. Each shard can be deployed as a replica set.\n",
    "\n",
    "- *mongos*: The mongos acts as a query router, providing an interface between client applications and the sharded cluster.\n",
    "\n",
    "- *config servers*: Config servers store metadata and configuration settings for the cluster. As of MongoDB 3.4, config servers must be deployed as a replica set (CSRS).\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are general steps to shard data:\n",
    "\n",
    "1) Create a separate database for the config server\n",
    "\n",
    "2) Start the mongodb instance in configuration mode\n",
    "\n",
    "3) Start the mongos instance by specifying the configuration server\n",
    "\n",
    "4) From the mongo shell connect to the mongo's instance\n",
    "\n",
    "5) Add all requered servers to the cluster\n",
    "\n",
    "6) Enable sharding for the database.\n",
    "\n",
    "7) Enable sharding for the collection.\n",
    "\n",

    "### 5. Observing the performance and failure problems when you push a lot of data into mysimbdp-coredms (you do not need to worry about duplicated data in mysimbdp), propose the change of your deployment to avoid such problems (or explain why you do not have any problem with your deployment) (1 point)\n",
    "\n",
    "The more users simultaniously load data, the slower this data dowmloading in MongoDB. I guess that sharding might help here, we can download data into different servers, so that will be faster. "
